## Frozen LIVE-RTSA reference (inst/extdata/rtsa_0.2.2_reference.R): numbers
## printed by RTSA 0.2.2 itself, so these tests do NOT depend on RTSA being
## installed and do NOT go through the Python reconstruction. Until 0.2.7.17
## the package's numerical parity was established against a Python port written
## from RTSA's sources; this file compares the compiled engine with RTSA's own
## output. (Alpha bounds are deterministic recursions, compared tightly. Design
## beta bounds sit on a uniroot() result with tol = 1e-9 and RTSA's own
## uniroot() iterates differ from ours at rounding level, so they and the root
## use 1e-7. The analysis route has no root search, so its beta bounds are
## compared at 1e-9 -- observed agreement is ~1e-15.)
