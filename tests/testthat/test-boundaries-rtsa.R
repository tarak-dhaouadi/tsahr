## *** LEGACY-ENGINE TESTS (R-only, pre-0.2.7.11) ***
## Everything in this file exercises the OLD pure-R boundary functions
## (.obf_alpha_boundary(), .obf_beta_boundary(), .rtsa_beta_boundary(),
## .rtsa_beta_boundary_analysis(), ...), which tsa_hr() now uses only as its
## opt-in fallback (legacy_fallback = TRUE, flagged in the result). The
## `qnorm(1 - alpha / 2)` final boundary asserted below is THAT engine's
## convention. It is NOT the current engine's: the compiled RTSA-derived
## design route sets the final futility bound equal to the final efficacy
## bound (the alpha recursion's value at t = 1, e.g. ~2.13, not 1.96).
## Tests of the current engine are in test-rtsa-engine-parity.R,
## test-robust-schedules.R and test-boundary-route-and-fallback.R.

  ## This deliberately does NOT hard-code the exact number of surviving
  ## grid nodes: an earlier version of this test used lo = 1.5, which
  ## (for r = 18, delta = 0, sd_incr = 1) happens to land EXACTLY on one
  ## of .rtsa2_z_n_w()'s own log-spaced grid nodes (node j = 72 evaluates
  ## to precisely -3 + (72 - 18)/12 = 1.5), so one extra node coincided
  ## with `lo` and survived trimming, giving m = 5 instead of the m = 3
  ## the test assumed -- a correct result from the code, just an
  ## incorrect prediction in the test. `lo` below is chosen off any such
  ## grid-node alignment, but more importantly this test now checks the
  ## invariants that must hold for ANY valid Simpson grid built on
  ## [lo, hi], regardless of exactly how many interior nodes (zero, one,
  ## or by rarer coincidence more) survive trimming: no error, an odd
  ## node count >= 3, endpoints exactly at lo/hi, a non-decreasing
  ## sequence, and -- the property Simpson's rule actually guarantees,
  ## and what the downstream recursion actually relies on -- total
  ## weight equal to the window width.
