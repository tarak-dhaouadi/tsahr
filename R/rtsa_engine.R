## RTSA-derived boundary engine (added in 0.2.7.11)
##
## Thin R layer over src/rtsa_core.h / src/rtsa_engine.cpp, which port RTSA
## 0.2.2's recursive-integration engine (alpha_boundary(), beta_boundary(),
## z_n_w(), searchfunc(), init_int(), recur_int(), prob()) end-to-end, and
## over R's own stats::uniroot(), exactly as RTSA's boundaries() uses it.
## This file only reproduces RTSA's *orchestration* (which root searches are
## run, in which order, on which information/spending scales).
##
## THE TWO ROUTES RTSA HAS.  RTSA::boundaries(side = 2, futility =
## "non-binding") computes beta (futility) bounds in two different ways,
## both through the same beta_boundary() called with side = 1:
##
##   type = "design"   -> .rtsa_design_bounds()
##       spending timeline = the looks `t` themselves; information scale =
##       t * warp_root, where warp_root ("root") is found by uniroot so that
##       the futility bound meets the efficacy bound at the final look
##       (t = 1).  Two root searches (second with the negative early
##       looks' spend suppressed, rm_bs).
##   type = "analysis" -> .rtsa_analysis_bounds()
##       needs a design_R (the design's root); spending timeline = t /
##       design_R, information scale = t (unwarped), delta fixed, rm_bs
##       iterated three times, no root search.  The alpha bounds this route
##       is run against are recomputed on the timeline t / design_R (they
##       are NOT the design-type alpha bounds).
##
## ** 0.2.7.13: ** tsa_hr() gained a `boundary_route = c("design", "analysis")`
## argument. "design" (the default, unchanged) uses .rtsa_design_bounds()
## only (DARIS = t = 1). "analysis" uses .rtsa_retrospective() (design pass
## for design_R, then the analysis pass against it) and moves the formal
## endpoint to design_R * DARIS, exactly as RTSA's own RTSA(type =
## "analysis", design = NULL) does -- see tsa_hr()'s own documentation and
## NEWS.md (0.2.7.13) for what that changes downstream (the "DARIS reached"
## verdict, the plotted endpoint, and the decision layer, not just the
## futility numbers).
##
## .rtsa_retrospective() chains them the way RTSA::RTSA(type = "analysis",
## design = NULL) does: a design pass on the observed looks gives design_R,
## then the analysis pass runs against it.
##
## IMPORTANT (the gap this file closes).  In both routes the efficacy wall
## at the FINAL look is the value the alpha recursion returns for that look
## (e.g. 2.127 for a 9-look schedule whose looks are dense near 1), not
## qnorm(1 - alpha/2) = 1.96.  tsahr <= 0.2.7.10 substituted 1.96; that
## changes design_R and therefore every beta bound.
