## Internal O'Brien-Fleming-type alpha-spending and non-binding
## beta-spending group sequential boundary calculator.
##
## This replaces an earlier dependency on 'rpact' for computing trial
## sequential monitoring boundaries. rpact's getDesignGroupSequential()
## imposes a hard, software-specific limit of kMax <= 20 looks (with only
## an advisory warning above kMax=10) -- a package validation choice, not
## a statistical one. A meta-analysis with many included studies (each
## study being one "look" in TSA) routinely exceeds this. The functions
## below implement the same underlying, textbook methodology directly, so
## the number of looks is limited only by computation time, not an
## artificial cap.
##
## Methodology:
##   - Alpha-spending function (Lan & DeMets 1983 O'Brien-Fleming-type
##     approximation, RTSA/CTU parameterisation, TWO-SIDED, side = 2 --
##     see VALIDATION below):
##       alpha*(t) = 4*(1 - Phi(z_{alpha/4}/sqrt(t)))
##     ** CORRECTED in 0.2.6. ** Versions 0.2.0-0.2.5.1 used
##     alpha*(t) = 2*(1 - Phi(z_{alpha/2}/sqrt(t))) -- the more
##     commonly-seen textbook two-argument form, quoted directly in
##     gsDesign's documentation and in several published trial
##     statistical analysis plans for "two-sided alpha spending". That
##     form is internally valid as *an* alpha-spending function (it does
##     reach exactly `alpha` at t=1), and would be the right choice in
##     those other contexts, but it does NOT match the specific TSA
##     methodology (Copenhagen Trial Unit / RTSA / Thorlund et al.) that
##     this package models itself on and that its own documentation
##     cites (Miladinovic et al. 2013, Wetterslev et al. 2009). See
##     VALIDATION below for the live RTSA::boundaries() comparison that
##     confirms the corrected formula and quantifies the error in the
##     old one.
##   - Beta-spending function (non-binding futility, O'Brien-Fleming-type,
##     targeting a central inner wedge rather than two outer tails, and
##     matching RTSA's own getInnerWedge()/beta-spending construction --
##     see inst/REVERSE_ENGINEERING_RTSA.md for the reverse-engineering
##     write-up, and the "RTSA / original CTU-TSA non-binding futility
##     engine" section below for the implementation):
##       beta*(t) = 2*(1 - Phi(z_{beta/2}/sqrt(t)))
##     implemented in .rtsa_beta_spend_OF() below. (An earlier,
##     un-doubled candidate formula, beta*(t) = 1 - Phi(z_beta/sqrt(t)),
##     was implemented in this file as .beta_spend_OF() but never used by
##     the actual boundary-solving code path above -- it was dead code
##     and has been removed.)
##   - Sequential boundaries at each information fraction are obtained via
##     the standard recursive numerical integration (Armitage, McPherson &
##     Rowe 1969; generalised for spending functions by Reboussin, DeMets,
##     Kim & Lan 2000), carried out here in "B-value" (Brownian motion)
##     space, where increments between looks are simple additive Gaussians
##     -- computed efficiently via FFT-based convolution (stats::convolve)
##     rather than an O(K*N^2) dense matrix, so this comfortably scales to
##     many looks (tested to K > 100 in well under a second per call).
##   - Non-binding futility (beta) boundaries are computed holding the
##     already-fixed alpha boundary, under the alternative hypothesis with
##     standardised drift theta = z_{alpha/2} + z_beta (matching the
##     single-look power calculation used elsewhere in this package), as
##     is standard for non-binding futility monitoring.
##
## VALIDATION:
##   - Alpha-spending boundary engine, FORMULA correctness (0.2.6 fix):
##     confirmed against a live call to RTSA::boundaries() -- the
##     reference TSA implementation this package documents itself as
##     following -- across the full 5-look schedule, not just one point:
##       > RTSA::boundaries(timing=c(0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1), alpha=0.05,
##                           side=2, es_alpha="esOF")
##       Upper: 4.877  3.357  2.680  2.290  2.031
##     The corrected formula alpha*(t) = 4*(1-Phi(z_{alpha/4}/sqrt(t)))
##     is clearly distinguishable from the pre-correction
##     2*(1-Phi(z_{alpha/2}/sqrt(t))) form, which gives 4.383, 3.099,
##     2.554, 2.254, 2.063 for the same schedule -- measurably
##     different, especially at the early looks, where it matters most.
##     Both forms independently satisfy alpha*(1) = alpha, which is why
##     this bug was not caught by the pre-0.2.6 Monte Carlo/closed-form
##     checks below -- those confirm the *total* spend is correct, not
##     the *shape* across interim looks. A first-look regression test
##     (`test-alpha-spend-rtsa.R`) pins the corrected formula against
##     this RTSA reference in exact closed form (the first look has no
##     prior boundary to condition on, so needs no recursive-engine
##     approximation).
##   - Alpha-spending boundary engine, full 5-LOOK RECURSIVE-ENGINE match
##     against the same RTSA reference: the full schedule above was
##     independently re-implemented in Python (a faithful line-by-line
##     port of `.convolve_step()`/`.obf_alpha_boundary()`'s math -- R's
##     `convolve(h, rev(kernel), type="open")` is, by construction of
##     that call, a standard convolution sum, which the Python port
##     computes directly) and run end-to-end (all 5 looks through the
##     recursion), not just checked in closed form at the first look.
##     IMPORTANT -- use the nominal timing actually passed to
##     RTSA::boundaries() (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0), not the rounded
##     `SMA_Timing` column RTSA *reports back* (0.205, 0.409, ...): the
##     two were confused at one point during this package's development
##     and produced a spurious ~0.06 "discrepancy" at the first look
##     that was really just a units mismatch, not a real formula or
##     engine problem -- using the correct nominal timing, the first
##     look matches RTSA to within 0.0001, as it must (it's an exact
##     closed-form quantity, independent of the recursive engine or its
##     grid resolution entirely).
##     Using the correct nominal timing, the Python port's result at
##     n_grid=2000 (this engine's long-standing default) was already
##     close to RTSA across all 5 looks (max absolute error ~0.003-0.006
##     in the runs checked), NOT the ~0.03 final-look error that was
##     reported in an earlier draft of this note. That earlier ~0.03
##     figure, and the accompanying "error shrinks from 0.0325 at
##     n_grid=2000 down to 0.0020 at n_grid=32000" progression, could
##     NOT be reproduced by the independent Python port and are not
##     currently believed to be accurate -- they were not confirmed by
##     an actual run of this package's R code (no R interpreter was
##     available in the environment that wrote that draft) and should be
##     treated as unverified until someone with R access runs the
##     snippet below and reports the real numbers:
##       t <- c(0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0); alpha <- 0.05
##       tsahr:::.obf_alpha_boundary(t, alpha, n_grid = 2000)
##       tsahr:::.obf_alpha_boundary(t, alpha, n_grid = 16000)
##     Pending that confirmation, `n_grid`'s default is nonetheless kept
##     at 16000 (raised from 2000) purely as a conservative, low-cost
##     safety margin: FFT-based convolution makes the accuracy gain
##     (finer discretisation of the recursive integral) essentially free
##     in practice for this package's actual usage pattern (a handful of
##     interim looks per `tsa_hr()` call, not a hot simulation loop), so
##     there is no real reason to prefer the smaller grid even without a
##     confirmed problem at 2000. A regression test
##     (`test-alpha-spend-rtsa.R`) pins the full recursive-engine output
##     against all 5 RTSA reference values at a 0.01 tolerance using the
##     correct nominal timing; this is expected to pass at both
##     n_grid=2000 and n_grid=16000 based on the Python check above, but
##     has not been confirmed against the actual R implementation.
##     ** Measured in R (0.2.7.21, at the default n_grid = 16000): **
##       tsahr:::.obf_alpha_boundary(c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), 0.05)
##         = 4.332634 2.963388 2.358980 2.012955
##       live RTSA 0.2.2 (inst/extdata/rtsa_0.2.2_reference.R)
##         = 4.332634 2.963131 2.359044 2.014090
##       error (FFT - RTSA): 4e-7, 2.6e-4, -6.4e-5, -1.14e-3 -- largest at the
##       final look. One schedule only: not a general accuracy bound. The
##       5-look snippet above (t = 0.2 ... 1) has still not been run.
##   - The recursive integration engine itself (the FFT-based recursion
##     below) was independently reproduced line-by-line in Python (scipy)
##     and checked two ways. These checks validate the recursion
##     MECHANICS -- i.e. that the engine correctly turns a given spending
##     function into boundaries that spend exactly that much alpha
##     overall -- independent of which spending-function formula is
##     plugged in; they do NOT by themselves validate which formula
##     should be plugged in, since (as the fix above found) more than one
##     formula can each self-consistently reach the target alpha at t=1
##     while implying materially different boundaries at earlier looks.
##     That formula-choice question was instead checked directly against
##     live RTSA::boundaries() output (above), not by Monte Carlo:
##       1. The K=5 equally-spaced two-sided alpha=0.05 case, run under
##          the PRE-0.2.6 spending function, matches the classical,
##          widely-published O'Brien-Fleming boundary constant (~2.040
##          final-look value) to within grid-discretisation error. The
##          formula-choice question itself (old vs. RTSA-matched) was
##          checked separately and directly against live
##          RTSA::boundaries() output, both in closed form at the first
##          look and, as of 0.2.6.1, end-to-end through the full
##          recursive engine at all 5 looks (see the VALIDATION entries
##          above for both).
##       2. A direct (non-simulation) 2D numerical integration for K=2
##          confirmed the constructed boundaries yield the intended
##          overall two-sided alpha almost exactly (0.0506 vs a 0.05
##          target).
##       3. A 100,000-replicate Monte Carlo across five configurations
##          (K=2, K=3 unequally spaced, K=5, K=10, K=39 unequally spaced)
##          gave empirical type-I error of 5.02%-5.22% against a 0.05
##          nominal target (Monte Carlo SE ~=0.07%) -- i.e. within 2-3
##          simulation SEs in every configuration checked, and with no
##          degradation at larger K. This was run under the pre-0.2.6
##          formula. The recursion machinery itself was NOT changed by
##          this fix (only the four-line .alpha_spend_OF() body was), so
##          this remains valid evidence for the recursion -- and a
##          smaller-scale re-check (20,000 replicates, K=2/3/5/10) was
##          run directly against the corrected, RTSA-matched formula
##          specifically to confirm the fix didn't break exact-alpha
##          control: empirical type-I error came back at 4.35%-4.93%
##          against the 5% nominal target (MC SE ~=0.15%), i.e. within
##          about 0.5-4 simulation SEs, consistent with correct
##          behaviour.
##       This engine-level validation was carried out without R (no
##       rpact comparison was possible in that environment); it is
##       independent of this package's own R test suite, but is not a
##       comparison against rpact specifically. Users who need a
##       like-for-like comparison against rpact should still do so
##       themselves for their exact design if that specific software
##       agreement matters to them.
##   - Non-binding beta/futility boundary engine: this is a materially
##     harder quantity to calibrate than the alpha boundaries, because
##     the realised futility-stopping probability under H1 depends on
##     conditioning on non-crossing of the (already-fixed) alpha
##     boundary at every prior look, not just on the beta-spending
##     function's target value in isolation. A Monte Carlo check under
##     H1 (K=5, theta matching the design's power calculation) found
##     that the realised probability of stopping for non-binding
##     futility, and the realised power (probability of crossing the
##     efficacy boundary), both deviate from their nominal targets by a
##     non-trivial amount (single-digit percentage points in the
##     configuration checked). Because the futility boundary is
##     explicitly NON-BINDING in this package (crossing it is reported
##     as advisory only -- see `entered_futility_region` -- and never
##     triggers an automatic stopping decision, nor affects the alpha
##     boundary or the "DARIS reached" verdict), this imprecision does
##     not compromise the package's type-I error control, which is
##     governed solely by the independently-validated alpha engine
##     above. It does mean the futility band drawn on the plot should be
##     read as an approximate, illustrative guide to when the trend is
##     unpromising, not as a boundary with a precisely calibrated
##     operating characteristic. See `?tsa_hr` for further discussion.

## Two-sided (side = 2) O'Brien-Fleming-type Lan-DeMets alpha-spending
## function, matching RTSA's own parameterization (verified directly
## against a live RTSA::boundaries() call -- see VALIDATION above):
## the per-side alpha (alpha/2) is run through the one-sided OF-type
## spending shape -- i.e. divided by 2 again inside the normal
## quantile, giving alpha/4 -- and the result is doubled to combine the
## two symmetric (upper/lower) sides. This is algebraically RTSA's
## commented `alphas()` helper evaluated at side = 2:
##   2*(1 - pnorm(qnorm(1 - alpha/side/2)/sqrt(t))) * side

## RTSA's actual non-binding beta-spending / futility-boundary engine
##
## ** RECONSTRUCTED in 0.2.7. ** Checked directly against the real RTSA
## R package source (RTSA 0.2.2, https://github.com/AnneLyng/RTSA:
## R/RTSA_helperfunctions.R, R/boundaries.R, src/first.cpp), which is NOT
## what the previous engine (0.2.4-0.2.6.9) was built from. That engine's
## own comments (later softened in 0.2.6.6-0.2.6.9 to "adapted from",
## but never actually rebuilt) described it as "a literal
## R implementation of the retrospective/analysis-mode 'inner wedge'
## algorithm supplied from RTSA's old TSA functions ('translated from
## java')" -- and indeed, none of the function names it cited as its
## source (betas_Obf(), sdfunc(), trap_old(), gfunc(), fcab_old(),
## qpos_old(), first_old(), other_old(), searchfunc_old(), getInnerWedge(),
## fakeIFY, tsa_beta_bound) appear anywhere in the actual RTSA 0.2.2
## source. It was a faithful implementation of a DIFFERENT, older tool,
## not of this package's own documented reference. See
## inst/REVERSE_ENGINEERING_RTSA.md for the full write-up of what that
## meant in practice and what changed here.
##
## This is a line-by-line port of RTSA's own beta_boundary(), z_n_w(),
## and searchfunc() (R/RTSA_helperfunctions.R), and of init_int(),
## recur_int(), and prob() (src/first.cpp -- ported to pure R here,
## since tsahr has no compiled-code dependency), specialised to the one
## configuration this package actually needs:
##   * es_beta = "esOF" (O'Brien-Fleming-type beta spending) -- the only
##     spending family tsahr exposes, matching .rtsa_beta_spend_OF()
##     below (unchanged from previous versions; its formula already
##     matched RTSA's real esOF(), just not the recursion around it);
##   * side = 1 passed internally to RTSA's own beta_boundary(), even
##     though the overall design is two-sided (side = 2). This is
##     RTSA's OWN convention, not a tsahr simplification: see
##     boundaries(), the side == 2 / futility == "non-binding" / type
##     == "design" branch, where beta_boundary() is always called with
##     side = 1 and an EXPLICIT delta override -- the futility "inner
##     wedge" is a one-sided construction against a fixed drift, not a
##     beta budget split across two sides;
##   * delta = |qnorm(alpha/2) + qnorm(beta)|, the same fixed
##     standardised drift RTSA computes explicitly in that branch
##     (`delta <- abs(qnorm(alpha/side)+qnorm(beta))` with the design's
##     actual side = 2) and passes into beta_boundary() -- a FIXED
##     theoretical quantity, not something derived from the shape of
##     the futility wedge itself (which is what the previous
##     "testDrift" engine did).
##
## The single most consequential difference from the previous engine:
## RTSA solves for each futility boundary DIRECTLY under this fixed
## alternative-hypothesis drift, using the ACTUAL alpha efficacy
## boundary (c_vec_alpha -- generally a decreasing-then-flattening
## sequence, not a constant) as the upper wall of the recursive
## integration at EVERY step, not a symmetric null-referenced
## construction that only gets reconciled with the alpha boundary,
## approximately, after the fact.
##
## RTSA's real algorithm also does NOT hide every non-positive futility
## value: it returns NA only where the pinned "zninf" sentinel (-20) was
## used because the incremental beta spend at that look was negligible
## (see boundaries.R's `abs(lb$za) == 20` checks). A negative non-binding
## futility boundary is a legitimate result -- it says the trial would
## only be flagged for advisory futility if the cumulative Z-statistic
## had already crossed to the "wrong" side of the null by that point --
## and previous versions of this package incorrectly suppressed it
## (`b[b <= 0] <- NA_real_`).
##
## One deliberate departure from a literal port: RTSA's own `boundaries()`
## achieves an exact meeting of the alpha and beta boundaries at the
## final, definitive look by root-finding (`uniroot(inf_warp, ...)`,
## rescaling its own "design" timing via `warp_root` until the two meet
## exactly) -- machinery that exists to solve a DESIGN problem (find the
## sample-size inflation that hits a target power for a not-yet-observed
## trial). tsahr has no such design phase: it operates directly on
## observed information fractions, with t = 1 defined as the DARIS/HARIS
## point itself. Rather than port RTSA's root-finding wholesale (a
## substantially different, prospective-design undertaking, not part of
## reconstructing the beta-spending recursion itself), this package
## keeps its previous, explicit convention: at the single definitive
## final look, there is no distinct "non-binding early stop for
## futility" apart from the main efficacy decision, so that look's
## futility boundary is set to equal the (exact, closed-form) final
## efficacy boundary qnorm(1-alpha/2) directly, exactly as previous
## versions of this package already did.
##
## VALIDATION STATUS (honest -- please read before trusting this for a
## real analysis): the alpha engine above was checked against a LIVE
## RTSA::boundaries() call (see VALIDATION notes higher in this file).
## This beta/futility reconstruction has NOT been -- no R interpreter is
## available in the environment that wrote this port, so none of the
## R code below has actually been executed, let alone compared against
## RTSA's real output. It is a careful, line-by-line reading of RTSA's
## published source, not a numerically confirmed match. Before relying
## on this for anything but an approximate, illustrative futility band
## (which is how this package has always described its futility output
## -- see the "Non-binding beta/futility boundary engine" VALIDATION
## note above), please run a direct comparison, e.g.:
##   design <- RTSA::boundaries(timing = c(0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1), alpha = 0.05,
##                               beta = 0.2, side = 2, futility = "non-binding",
##                               es_alpha = "esOF", es_beta = "esOF")
##   design$beta_ubound
##   tsahr:::.rtsa_beta_boundary(c(0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1), alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2,

## Small defensive helper (0.2.7.2, NOT part of RTSA's own code): a
## seq(from, to, 2) that returns an empty integer vector instead of
## erroring when `to < from`, i.e. when the requested index range is
## empty. Needed because R's seq() with an explicit `by` argument
## throws "wrong sign in 'by' argument" in that case rather than
## returning integer(0) the way e.g. seq_len(0) does -- see
## .rtsa2_z_n_w()'s own safety-net comment for the general issue this
## belongs to. Used inside .rtsa2_z_n_w() in place of the raw
## seq(3, m - 2, 2) / seq(2, m - 1, 2) index-membership checks in its
## Simpson-weight loop, which are legitimately EMPTY (not erroring)
## ranges whenever the integration grid has few points -- m == 3 in
## particular (i.e. exactly 2 nodes in `xi`), which both the 0.2.7.1
## za/zb clamp and safety-net fix, and, independently, a naturally very
## narrow [za[i], zb[i]] interval near boundary convergence, can
## legitimately produce. Not exported.

## possibly-distant boundary without wasting points on the bulk of the
## density.

    (r <= j & j <= 5 * r) * (-3 + 3 * (j - r) / (2 * r)) +

  ## Safety net for grid collapse: the two trims above are only
  ## guaranteed to leave >= 2 points in `xi` when za[i] < zb[i] with
  ## enough of a gap that at least one of the log-spaced nodes `j`
  ## falls strictly between them. If za[i] and zb[i] end up equal, or
  ## reversed (za[i] >= zb[i]), or close enough together that every
  ## node lands outside [za[i], zb[i]], `xi` can collapse to a single
  ## point (or, in principle, zero). That is a real edge case in this
  ## port (observed with the package's own example data under
  ## target_HR = NA / the circular-target scenario), not merely a
  ## translation slip: RTSA's own R source has the identical unguarded
  ## seq(1, length(xi) - 1, 1) pattern below, which throws "wrong sign
  ## in 'by' argument" for length(xi) <= 1 rather than the empty
  ## sequence a length-based idiom like seq_len(length(xi) - 1) would
  ## give (NB: 1:0 is NOT such an idiom -- it evaluates to c(1, 0), a
  ## length-2 *descending* sequence, not an empty one; seq_len(0) is
  ## the correct empty-sequence idiom and is what the fix below uses).
  ## As of 0.2.7, this collapse is also actively prevented from
  ## occurring during normal operation by a clamp in
  ## .rtsa2_beta_boundary_core() that keeps za[i] from ever getting
  ## closer than a small margin to zb[i] in the first place -- this
  ## block is the last-resort fallback if it still happens (e.g. from
  ## a future caller invoking this function directly with unclamped
  ## za/zb). Rather than erroring, or silently returning a physically
  ## meaningless single-point "grid" (which would feed NA/garbage
  ## Simpson weights into the recursion via out-of-range zj[3]/zj[m-2]
  ## lookups below), we widen back out to the full two-point interval
  ## [za[i], zb[i]] -- inserting a minimal positive width if the two

## RE-VERIFIED in 0.2.7.4 against a specific claim that this should be

## `esOF(alpha, timing)` is itself `2*(1-pnorm(qnorm(1-alpha)/sqrt(t)))`.

## (R/RTSA_helperfunctions.R): `esOF()` is
##   as_cum[i] <- 2*(1 - pnorm(qnorm(1-alpha/2)/sqrt(timing[i])))
## i.e. the `/2` IS present in the real function -- the claim was
## incorrect, and applying it would have reintroduced a real error
## (dividing the effective beta-spend rate in half, disproportionately
## understating early-look futility boundaries -- consistent with the
## "beta-bounds are far from RTSA, and further off at earlier looks"
## symptom that prompted the claim in the first place, but that
## symptom's actual cause was the missing information-scale root search
## below, not this formula). Do not change this back to `qnorm(1-beta)`
## without a fresh, direct read of RTSA's actual esOF() source.

  ## t == 0 is deliberately ALLOWED (0.2.7.4 fix): the 0.2.7.4 rm_bs
  ## suppression mechanism in .rtsa2_beta_boundary_core() (see below)
  ## zeroes the first `rm_bs` entries of the timing vector it passes in
  ## here, by design -- that is how RTSA's own two-pass root search
  ## suppresses an early look's spend after the first pass found a
  ## negative futility boundary there. This function's formula already
  ## handles t = 0 correctly with no special-casing needed:
  ## qnorm(1-beta/2) is always > 0 for beta in (0,1), so dividing by
  ## sqrt(0) = 0 gives +Inf (not NaN, and R does not warn on this),
  ## and pnorm(Inf, lower.tail = FALSE) = 0 exactly -- i.e. t = 0
  ## naturally gives zero cumulative spend, exactly the "no information,
  ## no spend yet" semantics that entry is meant to have. A stricter
  ## `t <= 0` guard here (as in 0.2.7-0.2.7.3) rejected these entries
  ## outright, which made every rm_bs > 0 call -- i.e. the entire second
  ## pass of the 0.2.7.4 root search -- fail unconditionally with this
  ## function's own error. That was the actual, near-universal cause of
  ## the "root search did not converge" failures reported against the
  ## first 0.2.7.4 build, not a genuine non-convergence of the root
  ## search itself (confirmed by direct reproduction: the same design,
  ## re-run in an independent Python port of this exact algorithm,
  ## converges immediately once this guard allows t = 0 through).

## collapse .rtsa2_z_n_w() now also guards against defensively (see its

## za[i] is set from one of three branches in the core recursion above
## (a fixed sentinel, a fixed 0, or an unconstrained root found by
## .rtsa2_searchfunc()); none of those three is otherwise guaranteed to
## stay below zb[i], and the sentinel/0 cases were not observed to
## collide with any realistic zb[i] in testing, but are clamped too for
## uniformity and future-proofing rather than relying on that holding.
## The observed failure mode (package example data, target_HR = NA) was
## the .rtsa2_searchfunc() branch returning a value that landed at or
## past zb[i] at a late look, where the non-binding futility boundary is
## expected to approach the efficacy boundary closely by design (they
## are constructed to meet exactly at the final, t = 1 look) -- `gap` is
## deliberately tiny (Z-scale, not probability-scale) so this clamp only
## ever bites in that near-convergence regime and does not perturb any
## well-separated boundary value.
##
## IMPORTANT (0.2.7.4): this clamp is applied to every look EXCEPT the
## final one. The information-scale root search added in 0.2.7.4
## (.rtsa2_find_warp_root(), .rtsa2_inf_warp()) needs za[nn] to be able
## to reach -- and, for `uniroot()` to bracket a root at all, briefly
## cross -- zb[nn] exactly as the candidate warp factor is varied; a
## fixed-gap ceiling on za[nn] would make that impossible (the search
## objective, za[nn] - zb[nn], could then never change sign), so the

## purely by .rtsa2_z_n_w()'s own degenerate-grid fallback. Not

## recursion, and RTSA's own fixed standardised drift
## delta = |qnorm(alpha/2) + qnorm(beta)| (side = 2, i.e. this
## package's two-sided efficacy design).
##
## ** RTSA-style information-scale warp, added in 0.2.7.4. ** A naive
## reading of RTSA's beta_boundary() recursion (what 0.2.7-0.2.7.3
## implemented) uses the SAME information fractions both for looking up
## how much beta has been spent at each look and for the standard-
## deviation scale the recursion runs on -- i.e. implicitly always
## "warp_root = 1". RTSA's own boundaries() does NOT do this: it always
## calls beta_boundary() through a root-finding step
## (`uniroot(inf_warp, ...)`, ported above as .rtsa2_find_warp_root())
## that searches for a scalar inflation of the information SCALE alone
## (org_inf_frac = inf_frac * root; the beta-spending fractions
## themselves stay unwarped) such that the resulting futility boundary
## lands EXACTLY on the fixed efficacy boundary at the definitive final
## look. Without this, the futility boundaries a naive port produces
## are systematically too conservative relative to a live
## RTSA::boundaries() call across the whole schedule, and the final
## look generally does not meet the efficacy boundary at all -- exactly
## the two discrepancies reported against 0.2.7.3. RTSA's own code then
## repeats this root search a second time, now suppressing (zeroing the
## beta-spending fraction of) whichever early looks came back with a
## negative futility boundary on the first pass
## (`rm_bs = sum(lb$za < 0)`), and re-solves for the root again with
## that adjustment -- this is also why RTSA's real output does not show
## a small negative number at an early look where essentially no
## futility band exists yet: that look's beta-spend gets zeroed on the
## second pass, which routes it through the zninf sentinel (see
## .rtsa2_beta_boundary_core() above) instead. Both passes are ported
## faithfully below, including running the suppression step exactly
## once (RTSA's own code does not iterate this to convergence, so
## neither does this port).

  ## constant here. That assumption is WRONG for RTSA's actual discretised
  ## O'Brien-Fleming-type spending recursion: the equality holds only for a
  ## SINGLE look (no earlier spending); with more looks the final wall is
  ## LARGER, and it grows with the number of looks (e.g. 2.014 for 4 even
  ## looks, 2.185 for 100 even looks at alpha = 0.05) -- it depends on the
  ## schedule, not on a continuous-monitoring limit. Confirmed against a
  ## live RTSA reconstruction: for one real
  ## schedule, RTSA's own final alpha boundary was 2.014090377368289, not
  ## qnorm(1-alpha/2) = 1.959963984540054 -- a difference large enough to
  ## materially shift the warp_root this function solves for (1.133242 vs.
  ## the wrong 1.097193) and, via the tightening step below, the reported
  ## final futility boundary itself (2.014090 vs. 1.959964).
  ##
  ## Fixed by recomputing the TRUE, schedule-dependent alpha boundary via
  ## .obf_alpha_boundary() -- the same side = 2 FFT recursion used
  ## everywhere else in this legacy engine, which is an APPROXIMATION of
  ## RTSA's own Simpson recursion, not a validated reproduction of it

## ** Added in 0.2.7.7. 0.2.7.9 introduced a REGRESSION here (reverted in
## 0.2.7.10) by switching design_R/delta/rm_bs to a side = 1,
## futility = "none", right_power()-based calibration, on the strength of
## an external "live RTSA reconstruction" that turned out to have queried
## the wrong branch of RTSA's own source. That reconstruction is WRONG,
## and has been directly falsified by re-reading RTSA's actual R/RTSA.R
## top-level wrapper (not just boundaries.R in isolation), specifically
## the branch that manufactures design_R when no prior design object is
## supplied for a retrospective analysis:
##
##   bounds <- boundaries(timing = timing, alpha = alpha, beta = beta,
##                         side = side, futility = futility,
##                         es_alpha = es_alpha, es_beta = es_beta,
##                         type = "design")
##   design_R <- bounds$root
##
## `side = side` and `futility = futility` here are RTSA()'s OWN top-level
## arguments -- i.e. whatever the caller passed to RTSA() itself (side = 2,
## futility = "non-binding" for the two-sided, non-binding-futility TSA
## this package performs), NOT hardcoded to side = 1 / futility = "none".
## So the design_R calibration call this package needs to reproduce is
## boundaries(..., side = 2, futility = "non-binding", type = "design")
## -- exactly RTSA's non-binding-futility, two-pass warp_root search,
## i.e. exactly .rtsa_beta_boundary() above, unchanged, called on the
## observed timing. That is what 0.2.7.7 did. 0.2.7.9's side = 1 /
## futility = "none" / right_power() path (boundaries.R lines ~69-90) is
## a genuinely different RTSA code path -- the plain power/sample-size
## root search used for a design that has NO futility boundaries at all
## -- and is simply the wrong branch for this package's non-binding,
## two-sided design, regardless of what any external reconstruction
## computed against it.
##
## .rtsa_beta_boundary() above (unchanged since 0.2.7.6) is a faithful
## port of RTSA's boundaries(..., side = 2, futility = "non-binding",
## type = "design") branch: given only a timing vector, it root-finds its
## own information-scale inflation (warp_root) from scratch so the
## non-binding futility construction meets the efficacy boundary exactly
## at the final look. That IS RTSA's own design_R for this design, per
## the RTSA.R trace above -- not a mismatched substitute for it.
##
## RTSA's actual type = "analysis" branch this package's own design
## reaches is boundaries.R's side == 2 / futility == "non-binding" /
## `else` (i.e. type == "analysis") branch (lines ~436-492): it does NOT
## run its own root search. It takes the design_R already solved above
## and calls beta_boundary() THREE times against it -- once unsuppressed,
## then twice more with rm_bs re-derived from the previous pass's
## negative-za count -- see RTSA_helperfunctions.R's beta_boundary(), the
## `if(!is.null(design_R))` block: the OBSERVED information fractions
## (`inf_frac`) drive the actual info/sd scale UNWARPED
## (`org_inf_frac <- inf_frac`, only appending `design_R` itself as a
## final point if the observed data has not yet reached it), while the
## beta-SPENDING budget consumed at each look is looked up against
## `inf_frac / design_R` -- i.e. against how much of the eventually-
## planned total information has actually accrued, not against the raw
## observed fraction directly. The fixed drift `delta` this branch uses
## is `abs(qnorm(alpha/side)+qnorm(beta))` evaluated at side = 2 (the
## design's own overall sidedness, matching this package's alpha engine
## and .rtsa_beta_boundary() above) -- NOT side = 1.
##
## tsahr has no separate prospective "design" phase of its own -- each
## tsa_hr() call operates retrospectively on whatever information
## fractions the included studies actually produced. This function
## reproduces RTSA's own two-step pipeline for that situation: when
## design_R is not supplied, it is calibrated by calling
## .rtsa_beta_boundary() (the side = 2, non-binding-futility, two-pass
## warp_root search) on the same observed timing `t`, then the design_R
## branch below is run against that root.
##
## VALIDATION STATUS: a careful, line-by-line reading of RTSA's published
## alpha_boundary()/beta_boundary()/boundaries()/RTSA() source, re-checked
## against R/RTSA.R's own top-level wrapper (not just boundaries.R read in

## Pre-0.2.7.11 boundary pipeline, kept ONLY as a fallback for tsa_hr() when
## the RTSA-exact compiled engine (R/rtsa_engine.R) cannot produce a result.
## Approximate: its alpha engine is an FFT convolution (not RTSA's Simpson
## recursion). Until 0.2.7.19 its futility route also substituted
## qnorm(1 - alpha/2) for the final efficacy wall; .rtsa_beta_boundary() now
## recomputes that wall from the FFT alpha recursion (the analysis wrapper's
## design_R endpoint still uses the constant). Measured on the reference
## schedule 0.25/0.5/0.75/1 (0.2.7.21): warp root 1.132483 vs live RTSA
## 1.133242 (error 7.6e-4; 3.6e-2 before the 0.2.7.19 fix), and the whole
## residual comes from the FFT alpha input (final-look alpha error 1.1e-3).
## See NEWS.md, 0.2.7.19 and 0.2.7.21.
